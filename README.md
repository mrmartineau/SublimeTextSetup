# <a name="essentials"></a> Essential Packages

## i. <a name="package_control"></a> [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) <small>by [Will Bond](http://wbond.net/)</small>
A full-featured package manager that helps discovering, installing, updating and removing packages for Sublime Text 2. It features an automatic upgrader and supports GitHub, BitBucket and a full channel/repository system.

### Package Control Installation
Installation is through the Sublime Text 2 console. This is accessed via the `ctrl+`` shortcut. Once open, paste the following command into the console:

```python
import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print 'Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation'
```

### Install a package with Package Control
Bring up the Command palette by pressing `super+shift+p` (super = cmd on Mac or ctrl on PC/Linux), start typing 'install' & hit enter when 'Package Control: Install Package' is highlighted. A quick-panel (like Goto Anything) will appear listing all available packages. Start typing the name of the package you wish to install, and then select it. Package Control will download the package file and install the package into the running instance of Sublime Text 2. You can look at the status area at the bottom of the editor for status updates.

#### Other Package Control functions
You can use Package Control to manage your packages, some of the most common action you will do is to install, disable, upgrade & remove packages. To do any of them, bring up the Command palette prompt & type whichever command you want. The rest should be self-explanitory.

#### Install/Browse more packages
Will Bond has also created a directory of community-created packages that you can search/browse. Check it out at http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/community


## ii. <a name="zencoding"></a> [ZenCoding](https://bitbucket.org/sublimator/sublime-2-zencoding) <small>by [Nicholas Dudfield](https://bitbucket.org/sublimator/)</small>
Zen Coding uses a specific syntax in order to expand small snippets of code, similar to CSS selectors, into full-fledged HTML code. **Install through Package Control**

#### Settings
I have modified the default settings so I have duplicated the `zen-coding.sublime-settings` file, moved it to my User directory & amended it so that "auto_id_class" is set to true instead of false. This setting enables you to automatically add `id=""` when a `#` is added with a tag. [View/Download my settings](https://github.com/mrmartineau/SublimeTextSetup/blob/master/User/zen-coding.sublime-settings)
```html
this:
<div #></div>

becomes this:
<div id=""></div>
```
